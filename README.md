# my-scripts-n-stuff
Just some random scripts and stuff I used to use and still use on my linux setup there might be some  horrible windows stuff as well but shhh! Don't look at that 😁. I wouldn't recommend you use any of it directly but feel free to use them as a reference or clean them up as they are pretty dirty and poorly made
